Graphite: Used in the anode, not the cathode, of lithium-ion batteries.\r\n●   III. Lithium: A fundamental element in various cathode materials, including LCO and LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate).\r\n●   IV.

Gandhi indeed pledged Swaraj within a year if the movement was faithfully observed. Although civil disobedience and non-payment of taxes were considered, they were not contingent solely on the non-attainment of 'Swaraj' within a year or government repression. Gandhi reserved the authority to initiate civil disobedience at his discretion",
